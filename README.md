# Fire-and-Smoke-Detection-using-Cisco-Packet-Tracer
Home fire detection is a matter of great concern, and thus many efforts are devoted in most developed countries to the design of automatic detection systems. A fire prevention system should reliably and in a timely way notify building occupants about the presence of fire indicators, such as smoke or high temperatures. A fire detector is usually implemented as a smoke sensor due to its early fire detection capability, fast response time, and relatively low cost. Other options for fire detection are based on gas sensors or temperature sensors fire detectors that use a single sensor, generally a smoke sensor and present high false-siren rates due to temperature.
